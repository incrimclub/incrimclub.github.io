Friday, October 20, 2023 at 10:57:15 PM UTC
Peige Carter | 'Your not a bother! The moment you suddenly appeared you became part of the group! Friends are here to help'

Friday, October 20, 2023 at 11:02:51 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'peige..that's why I lost all my other friends. was because I always told them stuff like this and they all ended up hating me because of it. I won't even let myself cry in public anymore because of them. It's why people don't like me. Because they found out that I'm depressed. People hate me because I'm almost never happy. I'm super sensitive and super insecure'

Friday, October 20, 2023 at 11:10:07 PM UTC
Peige Carter | 'Well I'm going to make a confession to you to. I hate myself, I'm super depressed and I can't cry. I almost always have a face on. And you know what? I will always be here. You don't have to take it but I will always have a hand out for you. You won't lose me just because of petty reasons like that. Everyone is different. I will accept you for who you are.'

Friday, October 20, 2023 at 11:10:38 PM UTC

Peige Carter | 'Of course'

Friday, October 20, 2023 at 11:17:36 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'I think you're a beautiful person. You're kind, and sweet. You have the best personality I have ever seen, you care about others more than yourself, you aren't afraid to help someone when they need you, you're just beautiful in general. This might seem a little crazy, but I see a lot of similarities between us'

Friday, October 20, 2023 at 11:20:39 PM UTC
Peige Carter | 'I agree'

Friday, October 20, 2023 at 11:21:20 PM UTC
Peige Carter | 'Thabkyou'

Peige Carter | 'You know you are an amazing person!'

Friday, October 20, 2023 at 11:40:17 PM UTC

Friday, October 20, 2023 at 11:56:53 PM UTC
Peige Carter | 'That message you sent means a lot it was beautiful'

Friday, October 20, 2023 at 11:58:05 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'ok, but that was probably the nicest thing I have ever done'

Friday, October 20, 2023 at 11:58:14 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'for anybody'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 12:03:27 AM UTC
Peige Carter | 'You know only someone with a good soul would say that. I truly believe you are a good person'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 12:06:49 AM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'peige, I have never been able to say anything like that. the only reason I was able to say it to you, is because I truly do love you, but you don't like me like that'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 12:22:46 AM UTC
Peige Carter | 'Yea I'm sorry but I'm not in a good place right now and I don't know if I'll ever be. I know it's hard not to care about someone like that and I'm super happy to have met you but I don't like you that way...'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 12:31:41 AM UTC

Bryce Stellmach | 'I've always wanted to travel. i don't even want to do it for the money, just for the thrill of seeing new places'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 2:01:26 AM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'when I'm older, I want to have 2 kids and show them not only all the places I went growing up, but also other places around the world'

Bryce Stellmach | 'I was born there. I'm a Texan'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 2:21:49 AM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'maybe that's why I've always felt so alone.'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 2:25:28 AM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'I'm sorry. You didn't need to know that'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 2:44:40 AM UTC

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 2:50:30 AM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'I miss Texas. when I lived there, I was actually happy. I felt like I was actually truly loved... but when I moved here, that all went away. I tried keeping in touch with an old friend. A couple years ago her and I made a promise to each other. We promised that if we were both still single when we were 18 we would get together... but she got into a really bad car crash last year... she didn't make it...'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 2:53:07 AM UTC
Peige Carter | 'Oh I'm sorry... what was her name? If you don't want to talk about it it's cool to'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 2:54:29 AM UTC

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 2:58:21 AM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'I promised myself I would never love anyone again.. but I guess that didn't last long'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:01:32 AM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be dead'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:01:59 AM UTC
Peige Carter | 'Probably wouldn't be fun'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:03:14 AM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'more fun than losing the people closest to me'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:04:33 AM UTC
Peige Carter | 'I guess but what bout the people who would be losing someone they care about in the process'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:05:13 AM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | ' to me. I haven't heard those words since she died. not even my own parents can say it to me'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:13:25 AM UTC

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:19:26 AM UTC
Peige Carter | 'Honestly I don't know if I could ever go through with it. I would always be wondering what would have happened if I waited another day. I know that life is hard but there's always something worth living for. You may not see it right now but there's always something to live for the grass the trees the wind the sun. Even tho you might not get along with people there still gorgeous thing to live for.'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:21:16 AM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'what's wrong with me'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:24:42 AM UTC
Peige Carter | 'There's nothing wrong with you. You just needed someone to confide in. Maybe try living long enough to figure out how to live again'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:26:06 AM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'it hurts peige.... it really really hurts...'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:28:12 AM UTC
Peige Carter | 'I know and it will never stop hurting but if you let that bring you down you wouldn't have tried. Honestly I just found out about Beatrix but I know she would want you to at least try'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:30:32 AM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'peige?'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:30:47 AM UTC

Bryce Stellmach | 'do you want to know why I hug you so much?'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:31:13 AM UTC
Peige Carter | 'Why?'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:32:14 AM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'because whenever you hug me back, I feel safe. I feel loved. Even though you might not feel it, I feel like there could be hope for us in the future if you give me a chance someday'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:33:41 AM UTC
Peige Carter | 'Maybe but I don't want you sticking on to something that is a maybe it's only going to bring you pain for this case and others'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:35:23 AM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'you don't understand, I haven't felt this way in quite a while. I know, I'm insane, but it's all true. I love you Peige. That isn't something I can just change'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:38:32 AM UTC
Peige Carter | 'I know you can't change it but I don't want it to be the thing that you hold on to. The thing that keeps our friendship together. You are such a special person and I want you to know that. Maybe you can't change it but maybe you will find someone that will also bring you happiness.'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:41:24 AM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'That's not the thing that's keeping our friendship together, but it is what made me have a real smile for the first time in a long time. it's what made me happy. You made me happy again Peige. you brought the old me back. Peige, you fixed me when I was broken'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:42:16 AM UTC
Peige Carter | 'I'm glad your smile is all that counts'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:43:48 AM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'oh ya, another thing about me in case you couldn't already tell, I'm very persistent. so just know that I'm not gonna give up easily'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:44:22 AM UTC
Peige Carter | 'That's fine because I'm stubborn lol'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 4:19:49 AM UTC

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 2:36:36 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'Hey, you'll do great. Don't stress about it'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 2:39:49 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'You want a little advice?'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 2:39:59 PM UTC
Peige Carter | 'Sure!'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 2:43:58 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'I'm in orchestra, so whenever I have a concert, I'm super stressed. But what I do, I think about who makes me happiest. So this Tuesday, when I perform in front of hundreds of people, I'm not gonna think about that, instead, I'm gonna imagine you're there next to me and that it's just the two of us. So if I were you, I'd just imagine that the person that makes you happier than you've ever been is there with you.'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 2:46:40 PM UTC
Peige Carter | 'Thankyou'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 2:46:57 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'Does that make sense?'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 2:53:42 PM UTC
Peige Carter | 'Ya It does and it's good advice'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:11:24 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't use it tbh. Nobody ever listens to my advice'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:11:53 PM UTC
Peige Carter | 'It's good advice'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:19:24 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'it's always worked for me. I'm hoping it works again on Tuesday'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:20:09 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'I'm gonna end up messing up in my concert'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:24:22 PM UTC
Peige Carter | 'I bet you will do amazing'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:25:05 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'everyone always tells me that I do, but they don't ever hear how much I mess up'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:26:57 PM UTC
Peige Carter | 'Well mistakes are bound to happen we just learn from them and grow. When ever I make a mistake it's so obvious but then I practice particularly on that part so it perfect the next time'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:27:25 PM UTC
Peige Carter | 'But then again nothing's perfect'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:27:44 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'I'd practice, but I can't take my instrument home. the case is broken'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:28:06 PM UTC
Peige Carter | 'Oh that's bad how tho?'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:28:47 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'If I take the instrument home with a broken case, there's a chance the instrument itself could break'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:36:47 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'and I can't afford for my viola to break'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:37:34 PM UTC
Peige Carter | 'How did it break'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:38:05 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'I don't know. I'm renting it from the school and the case has been broken since the first day'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:40:20 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'but my teacher is trying to find me a new case'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:47:19 PM UTC
Bryce Stellmach | 'but I'm so nervous about my concert that I asked my teacher to pull me in for flex on Tuesday so I can practice by myself'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:50:49 PM UTC
Peige Carter | 'That's good!'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 3:51:06 PM UTC

I'm sorry, but it's just how I am and I will always be thinking about how I could've had a chance with you if you had just said yes'

Saturday, October 21, 2023 at 5:20:11 PM UTC
